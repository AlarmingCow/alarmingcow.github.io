Hey there! I'm Colin. I'm your standard model software developer in Chicago. I like beer, coffee, food, and homebrewing. I wear hoodies to work.

My master's alma mater did a profile on me. You can check that out [here](https://masters.cs.uchicago.edu/page/colin-cross-%E2%80%9811-senior-software-engineer-backstop-solutions-group).
